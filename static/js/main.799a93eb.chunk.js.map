However, the situation is\n              coming to normal, and students are being called back to campus.\n              Also, the online semester increased the need for guidance to\n              confirm the mental well-being of the student.\n              <br />\n              GoodLives in association with IIT Kharagpur will be conducting a\n              series of Mental Health awareness workshops. The workshops will be\n              targeting multiple topics of college student's life and their\n              families.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <br />\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/photogr.1bb68ad0.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/elocution.37470b23.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/kgplex.bf8875c8.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/logomaking.8a37962a.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/workshopflute.77a1aa69.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/jan-timeline.ddae8333.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/mime.e2e5d796.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/result-music.a0755d10.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/comedynight.77e0688e.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc1.8c38951e.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc2.b2d973cf.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc3.9676a768.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc4.54a5b133.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc5.33e219b4.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc6.aa7a5295.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc7.a9689941.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc8.c0849d81.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc9.288f63ed.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc10.1141cb86.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc11.44de821a.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc12.d238b9ce.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc13.b4d3b7d5.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc14.deac7e69.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc15.1bbaff3f.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc16.594ab33b.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc17.efa51d45.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc18.8ccb37c2.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc19.51302c83.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sc20.8894f9e6.jpg\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport Layout from \"../../../components/Layouts/Layout\";\nimport Styles from \"../styles/socult.module.css\";\nimport globalStyles from \"../styles/committees.module.css\";\n// import ContactStyles from \"../../../styles/pages/contacts.module.css\";\n// import events from \"../../../components/Events/eventsData\";\n// import ContactCard from \"../../../components/ContactCard\";\nimport img1 from \"./images/tech/photogr.jpg\";\nimport elocu from \"./images/socult/elocution.png\";\nimport kgplex from \"./images/socult/kgplex.jpg\";\nimport logomaking from \"./images/socult/logomaking.jpg\";\nimport flute from \"./images/socult/workshopflute.jpg\";\nimport jantimeline from \"./images/socult/jan-timeline.jpg\";\nimport mime from \"./images/socult/mime.jpg\";\nimport resultmusic from \"./images/socult/result-music.jpg\";\nimport comedynight from \"./images/socult/comedynight.png\";\nimport sc1 from \"./images/socult/sc1.png\";\nimport sc2 from \"./images/socult/sc2.png\";\nimport sc3 from \"./images/socult/sc3.png\";\nimport sc4 from \"./images/socult/sc4.png\";\nimport sc5 from \"./images/socult/sc5.png\";\nimport sc6 from \"./images/socult/sc6.png\";\nimport sc7 from \"./images/socult/sc7.png\";\nimport sc8 from \"./images/socult/sc8.png\";\nimport sc9 from \"./images/socult/sc9.png\";\nimport sc10 from \"./images/socult/sc10.png\";\nimport sc11 from \"./images/socult/sc11.png\";\nimport sc12 from \"./images/socult/sc12.png\";\nimport sc13 from \"./images/socult/sc13.png\";\nimport sc14 from \"./images/socult/sc14.png\";\nimport sc15 from \"./images/socult/sc15.png\";\nimport sc16 from \"./images/socult/sc16.png\";\nimport sc17 from \"./images/socult/sc17.jpg\";\nimport sc18 from \"./images/socult/sc18.jpg\";\nimport sc19 from \"./images/socult/sc19.jpg\";\nimport sc20 from \"./images/socult/sc20.jpg\";\n\nexport default function Socult() {\n  // const techComTeam = [\n  //   {\n  //     RollNo: \"19AR10043\",\n  //     Name: \"Yashraj Bagaria\",\n  //     Category: \"General Secretary\",\n  //     Post: \"GSec -
