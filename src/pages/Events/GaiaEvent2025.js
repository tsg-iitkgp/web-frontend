            1 Earth Holdings Inc. is the first climate startup in the world with
            its own flag - a flag that took our founder two years to design. It
            symbolizes our mission and represents patient Earth more powerfully
            and purposefully than any flag before it.

            Galápagos Islands.

          <p className="gaia-event-paragraph">
            In Greek mythology, Gaia is the primordial Mother Earth. The Gaia
            Platform will bring this spirit alive by empowering and organizing
            the voice of mothers in defense of nature. A call to action has
            already been released by our Gen Z sister, Raisa Ameen, as part of A
            Sneak Peek of the Earth Cup Documentary.

          <p className="gaia-event-paragraph">
            On the Gaia Platform, there will be no "users" or "followers." We
            are all crew on this spaceship Earth. Everyone will be a{" "}
            <strong>planetarian</strong> - a responsible participant in a global
            purpose economy.

            We have a top-secret strategy whereby the Gaia Platform shall be
            able to generate 1 billion or more downloads on a single day. Our
            target is <strong>5 billion planetarians</strong> and
            <strong> 6 billion planet-friendly shoppers</strong> with a
            collective buying power of
            <strong> $25.3 trillion</strong> as of today. God is in the details.
