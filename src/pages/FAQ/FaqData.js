              ○	Can previous internships be considered as compulsory one - <br/>
              Compulsory Internship for Dual Degree Conversion: Some students switch from a 4 year B.Tech degree course to a 5 year dual degree course. If the student has already completed internship in an agency/ organization through CDC/ non CDC track (at the end of 3rd year), the department will take the final call on the following points: <br/>
              ■	Whether to consider the aforesaid internship work as a compulsory internship for a dual degree course. <br/>
              ■	If not, the student has to do another internship at the end of the 4th year for dual degree completion. In that case, (if CDC has already provided an internship opportunity) the student cannot enroll in the Internship Registration Process else the student can register. <br/>
              ■	In a nut-shell, CDC will provide the opportunity of an internship to the students only once.
