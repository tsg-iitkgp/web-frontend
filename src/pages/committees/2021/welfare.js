            Upholding the motto and values of selfless service, Student’s
            Welfare Committee presents a noble initiative wherein NSS and other
            interested students will volunteer to work with NGOs on their varied
            projects for social welfare.
            <br />
            Through this we intent to emphasize the spirit of “ Not me But you"
            while providing a platform for the students and NGOs to collaborate
            for social growth, through a tremendously fulfilling and rewarding
            experience. <br />
            We invite all the NGOs with their social projects to partner with us
            in this incredible opportunity to bring about a social change.

            Hello all,
            <br />
            “Anything that’s human is mentionable, and anything that is
            mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our
            feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less
            scary.” <br />— Fred Rogers
            <br />
            While the stigma around mental health issues in and of itself is a
            huge obstacle, the fear of not being understood makes it very
            difficult for us to open up about our struggles. With the aim of
            giving the students of our institution an opportunity to overcome
            these hurdles, the Students’ Welfare Committee, Technology Students’
            Gymkhana would like to inform you that IIT Kharagpur has partnered
            with GOOD LIVES- a well-known mental health service providing
            platform. In the spirit of the same, a “Mental Wellness Workshop -
            For IITians, By IITians” has been planned.

            "You don't have to control your thoughts. You just have to stop

            The online semester has affected our emotions, relationships and
            mental wellbeing in some or another way. However, the situation is
            coming to normal, and students are being called back to campus.
            Also, the online semester increased the need for guidance to confirm
            the mental well-being of the student.
            <br />
            GoodLives in association with IIT Kharagpur will be conducting a
            series of Mental Health awareness workshops. The workshops will be
            targeting multiple topics of college student's life and their
            families.
