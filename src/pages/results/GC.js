        A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling
        idea, which is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence. A
        topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or
        supports an essay’s thesis statement; it unifies the content of a
        paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and it advises the
        reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss
        it. Readers generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to
        determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph. That’s why it’s
        often best to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the
        paragraph. In some cases, however, it’s more effective to place another
        sentence before the topic sentence—for example, a sentence linking the
        current paragraph to the previous one, or one providing background
        information. Although most paragraphs should have a topic sentence,
        there are a few situations when a paragraph might not need a topic
        sentence. For example, you might be able to omit a topic sentence in a
        paragraph that narrates a series of events, if a paragraph continues
        developing an idea that you introduced (with a topic sentence) in the
        previous paragraph, or if all the sentences and details in a paragraph
        clearly refer—perhaps indirectly—to a main point. The vast majority of
        your paragraphs, however, should have a topic sentence. Most paragraphs
        in an essay have a three-part structure—introduction, body, and
        conclusion. You can see this structure in paragraphs whether they are
        narrating, describing, comparing, contrasting, or analyzing information.
        Each part of the paragraph plays an important role in communicating your
        meaning to your reader. Introduction: the first section of a paragraph;
        should include the topic sentence and any other sentences at the
        beginning of the paragraph that give background information or provide a
        transition. Body: follows the introduction; discusses the controlling
        idea, using facts, arguments, analysis, examples, and other information.
        Conclusion: the final section; summarizes the connections between the
        information discussed in the body of the paragraph and the paragraph’s
        controlling idea. The following paragraph illustrates this pattern of
        organization. In this paragraph the topic sentence and concluding
        sentence (CAPITALIZED) both help the reader keep the paragraph’s main
        point in mind. SCIENTISTS HAVE LEARNED TO SUPPLEMENT THE SENSE OF SIGHT
        IN NUMEROUS WAYS. In front of the tiny pupil of the eye they put, on
        Mount Palomar, a great monocle 200 inches in diameter, and with it see
        2000 times farther into the depths of space. Or they look through a
        small pair of lenses arranged as a microscope into a drop of water or
        blood, and magnify by as much as 2000 diameters the living creatures
        there, many of which are among man’s most dangerous enemies. Or, if we
        want to see distant happenings on earth, they use some of the previously
        wasted electromagnetic waves to carry television images which they
        re-create as light by whipping tiny crystals on a screen with electrons
        in a vacuum. Or they can bring happenings of long ago and far away as
        colored motion pictures, by arranging silver atoms and color-absorbing
        molecules to force light waves into the patterns of original reality. Or
        if we want to see into the center of a steel casting or the chest of an
        injured child, they send the information on a beam of penetrating
        short-wave X rays, and then convert it back into images we can see on a
        screen or photograph. THUS ALMOST EVERY TYPE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC
        RADIATION YET DISCOVERED HAS BEEN USED TO EXTEND OUR SENSE OF SIGHT IN
        SOME WAY. George Harrison, “Faith and the Scientist” COHERENCE In a
        coherent paragraph, each sentence relates clearly to the topic sentence
        or controlling idea, but there is more to coherence than this. If a
        paragraph is coherent, each sentence flows smoothly into the next
        without obvious shifts or jumps. A coherent paragraph also highlights
        the ties between old information and new information to make the
        structure of ideas or arguments clear to the reader. Along with the
        smooth flow of sentences, a paragraph’s coherence may also be related to
        its length. If you have written a very long paragraph, one that fills a
        double-spaced typed page, for example, you should check it carefully to
        see if it should start a new paragraph where the original paragraph
        wanders from its controlling idea. On the other hand, if a paragraph is
        very short (only one or two sentences, perhaps), you may need to develop
        its controlling idea more thoroughly, or combine it with another
        paragraph. A number of other techniques that you can use to establish
        coherence in paragraphs are described below. Repeat key words or
        phrases. Particularly in paragraphs in which you define or identify an
        important idea or theory, be consistent in how you refer to it. This
        consistency and repetition will bind the paragraph together and help
        your reader understand your definition or description. Create parallel
        structures. Parallel structures are created by constructing two or more
        phrases or sentences that have the same grammatical structure and use
        the same parts of speech. By creating parallel structures you make your
        sentences clearer and easier to read. In addition, repeating a pattern
        in a series of consecutive sentences helps your reader see the
        connections between ideas. In the paragraph above about scientists and
        the sense of sight, several sentences in the body of the paragraph have
        been constructed in a parallel way. The parallel structures (which have
        been emphasized) help the reader see that the paragraph is organized as
        a set of examples of a general statement. Be consistent in point of
        view, verb tense, and number. Consistency in point of view, verb tense,
        and number is a subtle but important aspect of coherence. If you shift
        from the more personal "you" to the impersonal “one,” from past to
        present tense, or from “a man” to “they,” for example, you make your
        paragraph less coherent. Such inconsistencies can also confuse your
        reader and make your argument more difficult to follow. Use transition
        words or phrases between sentences and between paragraphs. Transitional
        expressions emphasize the relationships between ideas, so they help
        readers follow your train of thought or see connections that they might
        otherwise miss or misunderstand. The following paragraph shows how
        carefully chosen transitions (CAPITALIZED) lead the reader smoothly from
        the introduction to the conclusion of the paragraph. I don’t wish to
        deny that the flattened, minuscule head of the large-bodied
        "stegosaurus" houses little brain from our subjective, top-heavy
        perspective, BUT I do wish to assert that we should not expect more of
        the beast. FIRST OF ALL, large animals have relatively smaller brains
        than related, small animals. The correlation of brain size with body
        size among kindred animals (all reptiles, all mammals, FOR EXAMPLE) is
        remarkably regular. AS we move from small to large animals, from mice to
        elephants or small lizards to Komodo dragons, brain size increases, BUT
        not so fast as body size. IN OTHER WORDS, bodies grow faster than
        brains, AND large animals have low ratios of brain weight to body
        weight. IN FACT, brains grow only about two-thirds as fast as bodies.
        SINCE we have no reason to believe that large animals are consistently
        stupider than their smaller relatives, we must conclude that large
        animals require relatively less brain to do as well as smaller animals.
        IF we do not recognize this relationship, we are likely to underestimate
        the mental power of very large animals, dinosaurs in particular. Stephen
